# MMBS FineTech Web Application

Welcome to the MMBS FineTech web application project! This project consists of a frontend home landing page built using React and SCSS. The landing page is deployed on Netlify at [https://mmbs-fine.netlify.app/](https://mmbs-fine.netlify.app/). This project has been instrumental in learning how to deploy a static site on Netlify using build files.

## Overview

The MMBS FineTech web application landing page serves as the entry point for users interested in our fintech services. It provides a comprehensive overview of our offerings, values, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **SCSS (Sass)**: A CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic CSS syntax.
- **Netlify**: A cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites.

## Deployment

The landing page is automatically deployed to Netlify upon pushing changes to the `main` branch of the repository. Netlify is configured to build the project using the provided build scripts and deploy the generated static files to its content delivery network (CDN).

## Accessing the Landing Page

You can access the MMBS FineTech landing page by visiting [https://mmbs-fine.netlify.app/](https://mmbs-fine.netlify.app/) in your web browser.
